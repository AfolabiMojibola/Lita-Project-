## Project Overview
This project shows the ways by which data analysis can be carried out in different areas of life. it also shows the different tools and ways these tools can be used to analyze data in their own special ways. 

### Data Analysis
___
Data Analysis involves inspecting, cleasing, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information, draw conclusions and support decision making.

### Skills required for Data Analysis
___
* Technical skills(Microsoft Excel,Python,SQL)
* Data Visualisation(Microsoft Power BI, Tableau)
* Critical thinking
* Data Wrangling and Cleaning 
* Communication Skills

### Tools used in the Data Analysis class
___
* Microsoft Excel [Download Here](http.//www.microsoft.com)
* SQL(Structured Query Language) [Download Here](http.//www.microsoft.com)
* Power BI [Download Here](http.//www.microsoft.com)

Other empowering tools used in the class
* LinkedIn: To optimize LinkedIn profile for a better career opportunity
* Github: For portfolio building 

### Microsoft Excel
___
This is a spreadsheet application used to store data and analyse data. In excel, there is data entry, formatting and data validation. 
* Data entry is the input of data into a spreadsheet before analysis
* Formatting makes data appear more visible in excel especially working with a large worksheet
* Data validation is making sure there are no errors in data inputs

#### Excel Functions
___
Some basic excel functions learnt during the class
 1. Sum Function: This adds up numbers in excel.
  Example: =SUM(A1:A10)
 2. Average function: This finds the average of numbers in excel
  Example: =AVERAGE(A1:A10)
 3. Max Function: This locates the highest figure in excel
  Example: =MAX(A1:A10)
 4. Min Function: This locates the smallest figure in excel
  Example: =MIN(A1:A10)
 5. Count/CountA Function: This counts columns that have numbers while counta is used to count columns with text or mixture of text and numbers
  Example: =COUNT(A1:A10) or =COUNTA(A1:A10)
 6. Large Function: This returns the "n" (ie 2nd, 3rd...) number in a column. 
  Example: =LARGE(A1:A10,2). 
  This returns the second largest number in a column
 7. Small Function: This returns the "n" (ie 2nd, 3rd...) smallest number in a column
  Example: =SMALL(A1:A10,3)
  This returns the third smallest number in a column

 Other excel functions include;
* Left function 
* Right function
* Mid function
* Random function
* Trim Function
* Cases function 
* V-Lookup
* Conditional functions(if, ifs, switch, and, or,etc)
 
#### Reporting in excel
___
Here, the Pivot table was discussed. The Pivot table is a data summarizing tool. It is used to manage a report in excel. It can be prepared from a table, range or from an internal data source. There is a field in the Pivot table which is used to categorise columns for a report.



### Structured Query Language(SQL)
___ 
SQL is a standard language for relational database system. it is used for storing and managing data in relational database management system (RDBMS). It allows users query the database in a number of ways, using English-like statements. We have RDBMS like MySQL, Postgre SQL, SQL Server etc which use SQL as their standard database language.

In this class, we focused on SQL Server. Here are some queries used in SQL Server
``` SQL

CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE

INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE

DROP TABLE EMPLOYEE
 
DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE STAFF ID = 'AB281'

ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE
ADD State_of_Origin varchar(225)

GROUPBY State_of_Origin

ORDERBY COUNT(staffid) desc

SELECT * FROM SALARY 
WHERE salary BETWEEN 50,000 and 100,000
```
The above queries have their specific functions as to what they can do in the SQL Server database

### PowerBI
